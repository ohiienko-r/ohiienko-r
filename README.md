# Who am I?

My name is Roman Ohiienko, a software engineer living in Europe. I have a little embeded software background and currently I'm working as a hardware engineer.

In April 2023 I returned to my dream of becoming a software developer and fell in love with web sector. As a result of my efforts, the first major web application I developed was a time tracking app, taking into account the specifics of the company for which it was created.

Currently, I work for a company while creating more apps.

# What projects am I working on?

Recently I have launched Bunny reminder - a desktop reminder app built using Electron JS. 

Right now I'm polishing my Time Tracker App.
